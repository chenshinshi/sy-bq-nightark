The code is sourced from frostime's sy-bq-callout and killuayz's siyuan-plugin-latest-notes. Special thanks to them.

Supports slash menu: use "bq1" to call out the first background color blockquote, and "bqs" to call out the success block (success card color).

Styles can be cleared via the block color panel.

The block menu for blockquotes was not implemented because the block color panel can be directly used for selection.

The theme itself provides enhanced styling for blockquotes when different block colors are applied.

Themes known to have special enhanced styling: nightArk, Savor.

Themes without special styling will still display different background colors.

The menu naming is not very elegant, PRs are welcome.
